## ðŸ“– About the project
Project developed as part of a coding/project challenge at DIO, as part of the BootCamp: "PotÃªncia Tech iFood - Game Development." The project is based on the Yu-Gi-Oh! universe and involves a card game. However, the game's rules are defined similar to a paper, rock, and scissors game, along with various other interactive elements that enhance the user experience. The project includes a tutorial button and window to explain how the game works, as well as a button to mute and unmute the background music.
